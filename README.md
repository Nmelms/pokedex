# Pokedex
This app was designed to allow users to view and learn about the first 151 Pokemon in the popular franchise. The design for the app was provided to me in a Figma file, and I worked on implementing it using the PokeAPI to fetch the data. This Pokedex app has been designed with both aesthetics and usability in mind, resulting in a visually pleasing and intuitive interface. With this app, users can easily view more information about individual Pokemon by simply clicking on them. The app also has a filter function to allow users to search for a specific Pokemon. Currently, the app only includes data for the first 151 Pokemon, but I hope to expand the app to include all Pokemon in the future and add the ability to sort them by generation.
